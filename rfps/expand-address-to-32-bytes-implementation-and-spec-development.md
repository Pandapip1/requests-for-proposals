# Extend addresses to 32 bytes: Request for Proposals

## Introduction

The Ethereum Foundation would like to announce a Request for Proposals (RfP) for the research and development needed to extend Ethereum addresses from 20 bytes to 32 bytes.

The proposed mechanism for this extension can be found here on the Ethereum Magicians forum: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/increasing-address-size-from-20-to-32-bytes/5485

This proposal has two primary goals.

- Expand the proposed scheme into a complete specification
- Implement it in one of the mainnet Ethereum client codebases. (Besu, Geth, Nethermind, OpenEthereum, TurboGeth)

## Scope

Implement the extension of addresses from 20 bytes to 32 bytes in one of the mainnet ethereum clients as well as creating an accompanying specification in the form of an EIP.

In addition, vendor will analyze and report on the impact this change would have on the broader ecosystem of tooling.

    
## Process Summary

The entire process can be summarized as follows:

- **Request**: EF releases RfP (this post)
- **Gather**: Vendors submit proposals
- **Deliberate**: EF decides which proposal to accept, and comes up with a plan based on the resources and needs of the accepted proposal.
- **Propose**: EF proposes the plan to vendor, and makes adjustments based on vendorâ€™s feedback
- **Begin**: Vendor accepts and work begins


## Timeline

We expect this project to take around four months, however we also expect this to vary based on things like team size and prior expertise. Proposals should include a projected development timeline which we will actively re-evaluate as the project progresses.


## Deliverables

- Public facing development updates should be published on a 2-week interval.  These can be simple factual updates about what work has been completed and what work is in progress.
- A Specification suitable for broader client adoption.  This will likely be a collection of EIP proposals.
- A mainnet client implementation in a fork of one of the existing mainnet client codebases.
- Presentation of EIP proposals in AllCoreDevs and engagement in AllCoreDevs discussions.


## Fee Structure

### Invoices

The chosen vendor will be expected to submit invoices every 2 months.


### Payment method

The vendor will be given the option to be paid in Fiat money (via bank transfer) or ETH.

If the vendor chooses to be paid in ETH, the value of ETH described under the agreement will be the value in USD at NYSE closing time (4 PM EST) on the day prior to the due date (as described at https://www.coingecko.com).

## Selection Criteria

The selected vendor will have significant expertise in the areas necessary to meet the needs and requirements set forth in this RfP. Particularly:

```
Familiarity with the Ethereum "State" trie
Familiarity with the EVM
Familiarity with how ecosystem tooling uses addresses
```

The scope of this work is large enough that we will be preferring teams over individuals. Individuals are still encouraged to submit a proposal as there may be options available for collaboration.


## Bidding Instructions


Upon reception of this request, interested vendors are expected to confirm receipt and intention to bid on the engagement.

In this confirmation, they should explain what they need from us in order to get started. As well as bring attention to areas in which they feel they do not have significant expertise. We will use this information to try to provide appropriate entrance material for the engagement.

Proposals must be submitted before **TODO**. We expect to take 1 week to deliberate and respond.

Please send initial confirmations, and proposals (in PDF format) to the following address: rfp@ethereum.org

> Feel free to send us any questions you may have: rfp@ethereum.org
